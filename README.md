# SFLE - Simple fast log entry

**Simple fast log entry** - a tool to enter QSO from your SOTA/GMA/WWFF activations and create the ADIF file - everything just in your browser.

## Working application is available on **[sfle.ok2cqr.com](https://sfle.ok2cqr.com)**

Written in HTML/Javascript by [Petr, OK2CQR](https://www.ok2cqr.com).

Heavily inspired by [FLE](https://df3cb.com/fle/) from [Bernd, DF3CB](https://df3cb.com/).
Unfortunately, the FLE works only on Windows and Linux using Wine, but I needed something working on macOS and/or
Android tablet. I&nbsp;didn't need all the features, just wanted to log QSO from my WFF/SOTA/GMA activation.
